### Issue CP-12457 REST API: Price-1 is being used when adding an line item to a ticket, vs the one sent in API code
### Issue CP-11550 Rest API - SSL Certificate issue during update unbinds the association to the current certificate
### Issue CP-12017 REST API Customer cannot run the API, they receive a DateTime error.
